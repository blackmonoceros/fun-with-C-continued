A very small and simple program that allows you to process data of selected employees at the police station. 
Include police officers and department heads. 
Use the mechanism of multiple inheritance and dynamic polymorphism. Assume that each policeman has a specific 
rank (e.g. deputy commissioner, commissioner, inspector), 
and each head is a policeman and at the same time manages one department at the station (e.g. road traffic 
department, prevention department). 
Access objects corresponding to examples of police officers and chiefs in the traditional way, using the 
access operator. (dots). 
Test the program's operation on the data of several police officers and department heads.
